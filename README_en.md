## Note

- DAO pattern. Since the gson package has been added for data operations, if it cannot run directly, you need to add the jar from the `lib/gson/` directory to the Project Structure dependencies.
- To run the game, you can double-click `AircraftWar.jar` or use the command line `java -jar AircraftWar.jar`.
